# PHYLOTYPER

Phylotyper predicts biological subtypes from gene sequence data. It build a reference phylogenetic tree from genes with known subtype and then uses ancestral reconstruction to assign likelihoods of each subtype to the branch points in the tree. A new unknown sequence can be assigned a subtype based on the extrapolated value from its ancestors in the tree.
